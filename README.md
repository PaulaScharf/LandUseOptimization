Land Use Optimization towards mining with minimal ecological impact in Mato Grosso, Brazil

---

# How to run the optimization
1. Install the necessary libraries by running the command `pip install requirements.txt`. It is recommended to install the libraries in a dedicated environment (e.g. using Anaconda).
2. Adjust the desired input adress in the file `init_pop.py` if necessary.
3. Execute the main file by running the command `python run_nsga2_custom.py`.
